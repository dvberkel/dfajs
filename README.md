DFA JS

This project aims to visualize regular expressions with the aid of
finite state machines. You can find more information about

Origin
------

Recently I was asked to construct a regular expression matching certain
numbers. I managed to construct a correct regular expression but was
surprised by the length. I did not expect it to be so long.

I tried to minimize it, but time prevented to pursue the subject
further.

This project is the culmination of my studies after the above incident.
